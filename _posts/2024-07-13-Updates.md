This post is to inform the reader to be aware of the fact that the 
Kalman filter assumes a linear state space (and observation model). In the model presented in my article I use also a quadratic term. 
While the presented model is linear in the variables, it is not in the parameters. As noted in the **updated article**, this is functional to a comparison of model performace
between its linear and non-linear components. Moreover, the observation matrix multiplies both velocity and acceleration by zero (since they are not observed).
This partly mitigates for the admitted inconsistence with the assumptions, however the model, as specified, cannot be regarded as theoretically correct (only for the quadratic part).
It serves a didactic and experimental purpose that will be explored further in articles introducing more advanced techniques. 

# FOR KALMAN (within this and next week): **UPDATED (SOME REFINEMENT TO COME, BUT ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS ALL AVAILABLE)**
\
\
-<del>Full code on GitHub.</del> **UPDATED**
\
\
-<del>More in depth explanation and some more intuitions (with the aim of presenting more advanced filters).</del>  **UPDATED**
\
\
-<del>Some references.</del> **UPDATED**


# IN GENERAL I AM PLANNING (next two-four weeks):
\
\
-<del>A more responsive website with formulas that become smaller depending on screen. Almost there! first experience with mathjax</del> **UPDATED**
\
\
-A new article on particle filters. **shifting to a posterior date: waiting for a book that might provide important insights**
\
\
-A new article introducing asyncronous programming vs. multithreading (with some mythbusting on python) vs. multiprocessing. **decided to blend with the article below. Updating in 48h**
\
\
-A project-only article of an asyncronous sitemap generator with full code. **code available [HERE](https://github.com/Gabriele-Donato/website-materials-/tree/Scraping/Asynchronous_Sitemap_Generator), article updating in 48h**
\
\
-A new article with applied project using PySpark and Pydoop. **essential code logic available upon request, [work in progress on GitHub!](https://github.com/Gabriele-Donato/website-materials-/tree/DataEngineering) Project: a sytem to continuously collect and clean data from the "Institute for the Study of War", to be analysed in a future article. Updating in the next 72h**


# HOPEFULLY IN THE UPCOMING MONTHS (next two months):
\
\
-A new article of my experience at ISBA 2024 with particular reference to techniques of historical prior elicitation (Bayesian framework). 
\
\
-A new section including the upcoming works and useful resources. **section created, it will be populated soon**
\
\
-A comment section under each article.
