Since it has not been possible to update the website, this post is to inform the reader to be aware of the fact that the 
Kalman filter assumes a linear state space. In the model presented in my article I use also a quadratic term, this is 
an approximation (and indeed note the difficulty of the model in estimating the acceleration).


FOR KALMAN (within this and next week):
-Full code on GitHub. **code available upon request, soon on github**
\
-<del>More in depth explanation and some more intuitions (with the aim of presenting more advanced filters).</del>
\
-<del>Some references.</del>

IN GENERAL I AM PLANNING (next two-four weeks):
\
-A more responsive website with formulas that become smaller depending on screen. **almost there! first experience with mathjax**
\
-A new article on particle filters. **materials gathered**
\
-A new article introducing asyncronous programming vs. multithreading (with some mythbusting on python) vs. multiprocessing. **materials gathered**
\
-A project-only article of an asyncronous sitemap generator with full code. **code available upon request**
\
-A new article with applied project using PySpark and Hadoop. **code available upon request**


HOPEFULLY IN THE UPCOMING MONTHS (next five-ten months):
-A new article of my experience at ISBA 2024 with particular reference to techniques of historical prior elicitation (Bayesian framework). 
-A new section including the upcoming works and useful resources. **section created, it will be populated soon**
