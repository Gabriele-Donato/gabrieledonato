<p>
Since it has not been possible to update the website, this post is to inform the reader to be aware of the fact that the 
Kalman filter assumes a linear state space. In the model presented in my article I use also a quadratic term, this is 
an approximation (and indeed note the difficulty of the model in estimating the acceleration).

The article is under revision and I hope to include between this and the next week the following updates:

FOR KALMAN:
-Full code on GitHub.
-More in depth explanation and some more intuitions (with the aim of presenting more advanced filters).
-Some references.

IN GENERAL I AM PLANNING (next two-four weeks):
-A more responsive website with formulas that become smaller depending on screen.
-A new article on particle filters.
-A new article introducing asyncronous programming vs. multithreading (with some mythbusting on python) vs. multiprocessing.
-A project-only article of an asyncronous sitemap generator with full code (code already available upon request).
-A new article with applied project using PySpark and Hadoop.
-A new section including the upcoming works and useful resources.
-A new section for presenting updates.


HOPEFULLY IN THE UPCOMING MONTHS (next five-ten months):
-A new article of my experience at ISBA 2024 with particular reference to techniques of historical prior elicitation (Bayesian framework).
-I am developing my ideas for a time management tool independent of clock-time. I plan to include a separate page that evolves with time, as my experience
increases. This project is linked to my ten-year experimentation with a number of (sometimes strict) daily routines and with the idea that wellbeing maximisation leads to productivity maximisation.
-A new article on volcanic eruptions through a Poisson-Gamma model (I will be visiting Stromboli Volcano in three weeks!)
