# Just a notice:

## The project is available on GitHub (except for the Hidden Markov model part, which has been an unexpected addition. The code for this part is available upon request). The HMM estimates the probability
## that Russia is in an "harshly attacking" or "softly attacking" state under the hypothesis that the absolute frequencies of word counts in a respected source should be an adequate proxy for 
## the intensity of the attack (it is possible to think to a number or refinements if one sees it in this way). 
## Since these additions have been last-moment (a job interview made me think about making a little bit more useful the pipeline that I had designed), the article will be published by next week.
